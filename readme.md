For this project, I created a simple calander application using HTML, CSS, JS & bootstrap. 

Here is a link to my project--https://clairebohlen.github.io/responsiveDayPlanner05/
```
I'm still working on the time element and the local storage issue. The planner will have 8 hours of time blocks, a submit button and a clock. When the user enters in information and submits, it will save to local storage and be displayed in the same are.
